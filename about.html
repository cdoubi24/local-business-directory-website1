      <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
      <p>
        In an age of mega-corporations and delivery apps, it's easy to overlook the value of small businesses.
        We created this directory to highlight local gems—from coffee shops and plant stores to bakeries and salons—so they can thrive in a digital world.
